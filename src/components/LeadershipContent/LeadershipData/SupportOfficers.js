        paragraph: "Mitchell Sharma is a Junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Mitchell is interested in a broad variety of computer science specializations, ranging from data science to web development. In addition to programming, he has a passion for education - working as a tutor for ESL & Japanese (his second language), and developing education-related programming projects in his spare time. Through his time spent as an ESL tutor, he learned of the adversities immigrants & minorities face as they try to establish themselves in the US: an often unforgiving & unequitable environment for foreigners. He hopes to contribute to SACNAS by bringing more computer science students into the organization, deploying events to further increase interaction & outreach, and helping underrepresented communities succeed in tech, and the greater STEM field.",
